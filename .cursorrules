This is an implementation of the barnes hut approximation for a n body simulation written in java and globalBase
the framework of the project is inside the java side, there are three packages: gpu, simulation, and uint
The gpu package are classes that help java interact with the shader code
The simulation package are classes that run the simulation and import the shader code
The UI package is stuff that is only related to the UI in the window

Settings generator is a function that generates the settings class based on what is put in the resources/settings/defaultproperties.json file

When you answer questions, be concise and dont add fluffy language like "perfect" or "i know just what the problem is!"
Be direct and try not to fall into needing to produce an answer, if you dont know say that. 
If my request is not possible say how I can change it to be implementable.
Explain exactly what you are doing, dont just say "I have implemented this" in order to appear like you did it, make it clear if you are unable to do exactly what I asked for
Ask for permission before implementing changes or changing more code outside the scope of the requested edits.

At the end of your responces, include at least 20 lines of "1" to indicate you are done with your response.
Note, if i have said I implemented something and you don't see that, you MUST REREAD THE CODE, since what you have can be incorrect.
